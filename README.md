docker-no-ip
============

This is a simple Docker container for running the [No-IP2](http://www.noip.com/) dynamic DNS update script. It will keep
your domain.ddns.net DNS alias up-to-date as your home IP changes.

Usage
-----

This docker image is available as a [trusted build on the docker index](https://index.docker.io/u/coppit/no-ip/).

Run:

```
sudo docker run \
  -d \
  --name=noip \ 
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime \
  -v /config/dir/path:/config \
  -e USERNAME="email@example.com" \
  -e PASSWORD="your password here" \
  -e DOMAINS="foo.ddns.net" \
  -e INTERVAL="30m" 
 coppit/no-ip
```

When run for the first time, a file named noip.conf will be created in the config dir. After the first run, the environment variables are useless you can abandn them.
Edit noip.conf file with text editor, if you want to modify your settings.

A binary config file /config/dir/path/no-ip2.generated.conf will also be generated. Please do not edit this file, as it is used by the noip2 agent.

To check the status, run `docker logs noip`.
